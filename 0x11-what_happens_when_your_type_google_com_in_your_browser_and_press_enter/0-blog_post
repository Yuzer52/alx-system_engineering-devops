# What Happens When We Type https://www.google.com in Our Browser and Press Enter

In today's digital age, the simple act of typing a URL into our web browser and pressing Enter involves a complex series of steps behind the scenes. Understanding these steps provides insight into how the internet works and the technologies that make it possible. Let's take a deep dive into what happens when we type `https://www.google.com` in our browser and press Enter.

## 1. DNS Request

### What is DNS?
DNS (Domain Name System) is often referred to as the phonebook of the internet. It translates human-readable domain names like `www.google.com` into IP addresses, which computers use to identify each other on the network.

### Step-by-Step DNS Resolution
1. **Browser Cache**: First, the browser checks its cache to see if it has recently visited the URL and has the corresponding IP address.
2. **OS Cache**: If the browser cache doesn’t have the IP address, the operating system checks its own cache.
3. **Router Cache**: If the OS cache doesn’t have the IP address, the request is sent to the local router, which also has a DNS cache.
4. **ISP DNS Server**: If the router doesn’t have the IP address, it forwards the request to the ISP's (Internet Service Provider) DNS server.
5. **Recursive Search**: If the ISP’s DNS server doesn’t have the information, it performs a recursive search by querying other DNS servers, starting with the root DNS servers, then the TLD (Top-Level Domain) DNS servers, and finally the authoritative DNS servers for `google.com`.
6. **Response**: Once the IP address is found, it is returned to the browser, and the caches along the way store the information for future use.

## 2. TCP/IP

### Establishing a Connection
Once the IP address is known, the browser needs to establish a connection to the server. This is done using the TCP/IP protocol suite.

1. **TCP Handshake**: 
    - **SYN**: The client (our browser) sends a SYN (synchronize) packet to the server.
    - **SYN-ACK**: The server responds with a SYN-ACK (synchronize-acknowledge) packet.
    - **ACK**: The client sends an ACK (acknowledge) packet back to the server. This completes the three-way handshake, establishing a TCP connection.

2. **IP Layer**: The TCP segments are encapsulated in IP packets that are routed over the internet. Routers and switches along the way determine the best path to the server.

## 3. Firewall

### Role of Firewalls
Firewalls protect networks by controlling incoming and outgoing traffic based on predetermined security rules. They act as barriers between trusted internal networks and untrusted external networks (like the internet).

1. **Client-side Firewall**: Our local firewall ensures that the outgoing request is allowed.
2. **Network Firewall**: At the ISP level, another firewall may check the traffic.
3. **Server-side Firewall**: When the request reaches Google’s network, a firewall checks if the incoming request is legitimate and if the server is allowed to respond to it.

## 4. HTTPS/SSL

### Securing the Connection
`https://` indicates that the connection should be secure, using SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security).

1. **SSL Handshake**: 
    - **Client Hello**: The client sends a "Client Hello" message, which includes the SSL version and cipher suites it supports.
    - **Server Hello**: The server responds with a "Server Hello" message, selecting the SSL version and cipher suite.
    - **Server Certificate**: The server sends its SSL certificate to the client. The client verifies the certificate against a list of trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs).
    - **Key Exchange**: The client and server exchange keys to establish a secure session.

2. **Encryption**: Once the SSL handshake is complete, all data sent between the client and server is encrypted, ensuring privacy and integrity.

## 5. Load-Balancer

### Distributing the Load
Large websites like Google use load balancers to distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure reliability and performance.

1. **Request Routing**: The load balancer receives the incoming request and determines which backend server should handle the request based on factors like current load, server health, and geographical proximity.
2. **Session Persistence**: In some cases, the load balancer ensures that subsequent requests from the same client are directed to the same server.

## 6. Web Server

### Handling the Request
The web server is responsible for handling HTTP requests and serving web pages.

1. **Request Parsing**: The web server parses the incoming HTTP request to understand what the client is asking for.
2. **Static Content**: If the request is for a static resource (like an image or a static HTML page), the web server retrieves it from the file system and sends it back to the client.
3. **Dynamic Content**: If the request requires dynamic content (like a search query on Google), the web server forwards the request to the application server.

## 7. Application Server

### Processing the Request
The application server executes the logic needed to generate dynamic content.

1. **Business Logic**: The application server processes the request using business logic, which might involve querying databases, interacting with other services, or performing computations.
2. **Generating Response**: Once the processing is complete, the application server generates a response (e.g., an HTML page) and sends it back to the web server.

## 8. Database

### Retrieving Data
For many requests, especially those involving dynamic content, the application server interacts with one or more databases.

1. **Database Query**: The application server sends a query to the database to retrieve the necessary data. This could involve SQL queries for relational databases or API calls for NoSQL databases.
2. **Data Processing**: The database processes the query and returns the results to the application server.
3. **Response Construction**: The application server uses the retrieved data to construct the response that will be sent back to the client.

## Putting It All Together

Here's a summary of the entire process:

1. **DNS Request**: The browser translates `www.google.com` to an IP address using DNS.
2. **TCP/IP**: A TCP connection is established between the client and the server.
3. **Firewall**: Firewalls at various points ensure the request is allowed.
4. **HTTPS/SSL**: An SSL handshake secures the connection.
5. **Load-Balancer**: A load balancer routes the request to an appropriate web server.
6. **Web Server**: The web server handles the HTTP request.
7. **Application Server**: The application server processes the request and interacts with databases if needed.
8. **Database**: The database retrieves data and sends it back to the application server.
9. **Response**: The response is sent back through the web server, load balancer, and over the secured connection to the client’s browser, which renders the page.

This complex process happens in a fraction of a second, allowing users to seamlessly access information on the internet. Understanding each step highlights the remarkable engineering behind a simple web request.
