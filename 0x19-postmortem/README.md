Issue Summary
Duration of Outage: June 10, 2024, from 01:00 PM to 03:45 PM.
Impact:
Service affected: Online banking transaction processing
User experience: Users experienced delays and failures when attempting to complete transactions; error messages displayed intermittently
Percentage of users affected: Approximately 85%
Root Cause: A database deadlock caused by a flawed transaction handling mechanism in a recent software update.
Timeline
01:00 PM: Issue detected by automated monitoring system alerting a sudden drop in successful transaction rates.
01:05 PM: Incident escalated to the on-call database administrator and development team.
01:15 PM: Initial investigation focused on recent software updates, suspecting a bug in the transaction processing code.
01:30 PM: Rollback of the latest update performed; however, the issue persisted.
02:00 PM: Detailed examination of database logs and server performance metrics began.
02:15 PM: Misleading path: Network issues suspected and checked; found to be functioning normally.
02:30 PM: Escalated to the senior database architect for deeper analysis.
02:45 PM: Root cause identified as a database deadlock condition caused by the new transaction handling mechanism.
03:00 PM: Database transactions temporarily halted to break the deadlock.
03:15 PM: Transaction handling code fixed and redeployed.
03:30 PM: System monitored for stability; transaction processing resumed normally.
03:45 PM: Full functionality restored; continued monitoring to ensure no further issues.



Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause: The issue was caused by a database deadlock scenario introduced by a new transaction handling mechanism in the recent software update. The update included a change intended to optimize transaction processing but inadvertently led to certain transactions locking resources in a way that created a deadlock. This prevented other transactions from proceeding, causing delays and failures.
Resolution: Once the deadlock was identified, the following steps were taken to resolve the issue:
Halted all database transactions to clear the deadlock.
Reverted the transaction handling mechanism to the previous stable version.
Modified the transaction handling code to avoid resource locking patterns that could cause deadlocks.
Thoroughly tested the new code to ensure it did not reintroduce the deadlock issue.
Deployed the fixed code and resumed normal transaction processing.
Monitored the system closely to confirm that the issue was fully resolved and transactions were processed correctly.
Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements:
Enhance transaction handling code reviews to identify and prevent potential deadlock scenarios.
Improve database monitoring to detect and alert on deadlock conditions promptly.
Implement more rigorous testing procedures for changes to critical transaction processing logic.
Task List:
Patch Database Software:
Update database software to the latest version with improved deadlock handling capabilities.
Add Monitoring:
Implement advanced monitoring for transaction processing and deadlock detection.
Set up alerts for unusual patterns indicating potential deadlocks.
Code Review Enhancements:
Establish stricter code review protocols for transaction-related code to catch potential deadlocks.
Automated Testing:
Develop automated tests specifically targeting transaction processing to simulate and detect deadlock scenarios.
Training and Documentation:
Provide training for developers and database administrators on best practices for avoiding deadlocks.
Document common deadlock patterns and resolution strategies.
Regular Audits:
Conduct regular audits of transaction handling code and database performance to identify and mitigate risks proactively.
By implementing these measures, we aim to enhance the reliability of our transaction processing system, minimize the risk of future deadlocks, and ensure a seamless user experience.
